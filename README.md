# Ethereum Track : Trustful.Vaidya

## Short description of the hack :
### Part A :
A blockchain based verification platform for crowd sourced homemdade remedies for common ailments. Currently such knowledge is scattered across the world wide web and with hardly any vetting or verification mechanism.
### Part B :
An integrated  marketplace for economically excluded commmunities who forage and source ingredients that can be used in remedies aforementioned and related medical properties.
  

## Problems we aimed to tackle :
1. Combat false information about homemade remedies
2. Preserving our cultural heritage and tradional medicinal know-how which is currently spread across discrete demographics.
3. Provide livelihood opportunities for communities excluded from economic growth and those heavily dependent on mother nature. 

### Our Target Audience :
#### 1. People with knowledge of home made remdies :
        Opportunity to share their knowledge with the world.
#### 2. Subject Experts (In majority cases, proficient with Ayurveda)
        Opportunity to earn incentives (such as tokens) in exhange of performing verification and vetting.
#### 3. Economically excluded communities from rural India : 
        Better economic avenues and an access to a large untapped urban market.
        
#### 4. Govt. of India (Specifically Ayush Ministry)
        Although it will bare the cost of hosting the platform, the returns (preserving heritage + opprtunity to boost rural economy) will justify the investment over long term.
        


### Stack 
#### A. For corwdsourced repository of Repo  and the integrated marketplace
  1. Postrges Sql.
  2. Html css.
#### B. For vetting portal by experts :
 1. Html ,bootstrap, jquery
 2. Ethereum 
 3. Truffle suite 
 4. Web3js 
 
 ##### Note : Blockchain transactions are only performed by designated experts. They store only hash of the approved data and their signatures, thus keeping transaction costs at a minimum.
 
 ###### Problems encountered by us in implementing the application
 1. No mentors arranged by organizers at the venue.
 2. Volatile documentation of drizzle library which we originally intended to use for the blockchain integration. We had to pivot to web3 in the final stages.
 3. Inefficient truffle workflow to develop smart contracts. We shall evaluate matic network technology to build upon in the next hackathons
